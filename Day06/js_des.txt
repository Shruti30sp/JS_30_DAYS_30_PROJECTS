let speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance();
 ---- This creates an instance of SpeechSynthesisUtterance, which is used to convert text to speech.

let voices = [];
----This will store all available speech synthesis voices.
The voices are loaded asynchronously, so we need to wait for them before using them.


let voicesSelect = document.querySelector("select");
----This selects the <select> element from the HTML.
It will be used to display the available voices so the user can choose one.

window.speechSynthesis.onvoiceschanged = () => {
-----Some browsers load voices asynchronously, so we use onvoiceschanged to wait for them.


  voices = window.speechSynthesis.getVoices();
-----This retrieves all available voices and stores them in the voices array.

  speech.voice = voices[0];
------Sets the default voice to the first available voice.

 voices.forEach(
    (voice, i) => (voicesSelect.options[i] = new Option(voice.name, i))
  );
------This populates the <select> dropdown with the list of available voices.
new Option(voice.name, i) creates a new <option> for each voice.


voicesSelect.addEventListener("change", () => {
  speech.voice = voices[voicesSelect.value];
});
-------Listens for a change in the <select> dropdown.
When the user selects a different voice, speech.voice is updated to the selected one.


  speech.text = document.querySelector("textarea").value;
------Gets the text from the <textarea> and assigns it to speech.text.

window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);
-------Calls speak() to read the text aloud using the selected voice.
